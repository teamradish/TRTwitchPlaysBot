# TRTwitchPlaysBot
A TwitchPlays bot for Team Radish. Continuing the legacy of TwitchPlays_Everything.

This Twitch bot contains many features that facilitate handling Twitch Plays games. It uses [TwitchLib](https://github.com/TwitchLib/TwitchLib) to handle Twitch connection.

## Features
* Powerful input parser with a flexible, expressive syntax - provided by JDog (aka TwitchPlays_Everything) and converted to C# by [tdeeb](https://github.com/tdeeb) (aka Kimimaru)
* Efficient vJoy controller handling with simple methods to press and release input buttons and axes
* Performant multi-threaded input handler with support for stopping all ongoing inputs
* Flexible console infrastructure - supports NES, SNES, N64, GC, Wii, and more that can be easily added
* Powerful Twitch Plays features - macros, savestate support, game logs, and silencing users (without having to timeout on Twitch)
* User data with access levels that restrict/allow access to certain commands
* Several additional bot goodies and games, such as dueling, jump rope, and memes

## Getting Started
