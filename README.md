TRBot is software that enables playing video games through text. In simple terms, if you type "a", the character in your game will jump.

TRBot contains a comprehensive set of projects to facilitate text-based gameplay, some of which allow for setting up and managing community-oriented remote play, including Twitch Plays. The goal of TRBot is to lower the barrier of entry for text-based gameplay, such as Twitch Plays, and provide avenues to improve the experience.

TRBot is inspired by the bot used on the TwitchPlays_Everything channel. The input syntax allows for great precision, making it well-suited for many types of games, whether it's an RPG or a 3D platformer. You can use TRBot for many purposes, including collaborative remote play and automating tedious tasks, such as mashing buttons or grinding levels in an RPG.

The core application, `TRBot.Main`, connects all the projects of TRBot together to form a fully functional bot with input handling, commands, service connectivity, and more!

## Documentation, setup, building from source, playing
- See the [wiki home](./Wiki/Home.md) for your use-case(s).
- See the [FAQ](./Wiki/FAQ.md) for answers to commonly asked questions.

## Features
- [Simple yet expressive input syntax](./Wiki/Syntax-Walkthrough.md) - translate your text to game inputs easily. Make your inputs as simple or precise as you want!
- Portable and game-agnostic - TRBot runs alongside your game and can be configured as you like. No complex installation required - just download and run!
- Cross-platform - Runs on Windows (vJoy) and GNU/Linux (uinput).
- Virtual gamepads - Use analog inputs for precision and set custom button mappings in games to play how you prefer.
- Run locally or through Twitch - TRBot is also set up for integrating other services.
- Emulator support - NES, SNES, N64, GCN, and more. Several [emulator controller config files](./Controller%20Configs) are available.
- Multiplayer support - Control [multiple players](./Wiki/Syntax-Walkthrough.md#multi-controller-inputs) separately or simultaneously.
- Highly performant input handling with near frame-perfect inputs. Play with precision and consistency.
- Flexible "console" infrastructure - change inputs, add new inputs, or even add a new console with a different set of inputs, on the fly.
- Twitch Plays quality-of-life enhancements - macros, game logs, user silencing (without timeout/ban), stop all ongoing inputs, and switch consoles readily.
- Pluggable virtual controller architecture - add your own virtual controller implementation to support more platforms.
- Modular - TRBot is separated into parts, allowing those parts to be used as libraries.
- Commands - Interact with and manipulate TRBot through commands entered as text. [Add your own commands](./Wiki/Custom-Commands.md) to extend TRBot's capabilities, even **while** it's running!
- SQLite database containing all data and settings, including access levels, commands, virtual controller count, and more. Data changes are immediately reflected in TRBot.
- Sleep prevention - prevent games and consoles from going to sleep with a periodic input and interval of your choosing.
- Reset prevention - forbid players from hitting button combos to reset the game.
- Moderation features - control access to commands, inputs, and other features independent of platform.
- Additional goodies and games - duel for credits, create memes, calculate expressions, and [talk to a chatbot](./Wiki/Setup-Chatterbot.md).

## Credits
The original parser was written in Python by TwitchPlays_Everything and greatly helped jump-start TRBot's development.
