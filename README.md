TRBot is software that enables playing video games through text. It contains a comprehensive set of projects to facilitate text-based gameplay, some of which allow for setting up and managing community-oriented remote play, such as Twitch Plays. The goal of TRBot is to lower the barrier of entry for text-based gameplay, such as Twitch Plays, and provide avenues to improve the experience.

TRBot is inspired by TwitchPlays_Everything. The input syntax allows for great precision, making it well-suited for many types of games. You can use it for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, allowing others to play games remotely and automating tedious/repetitive tasks in your own playthroughs, such as mashing buttons or grinding levels in an RPG.

Please see the [FAQ](./Wiki/FAQ.md) for answers to commonly asked questions.

## Features
* [Simple yet expressive input syntax](./Wiki/Syntax-Walkthrough.md) - translate your text to game inputs easily. Make your inputs as simple or precise as you want!
* Portable and game-agnostic - TRBot runs alongside your game and can be configured as you like. No complex installation required - just download and run it!
* Cross-platform - Runs on Windows (vJoy) and GNU/Linux (uinput).
* Emulator support - NES, SNES, N64, GCN, and more. Several [emulator controller config files](./Emulator%20Controller%20Configs) are available.
* Multiplayer support - Control [multiple players](./Wiki/Syntax-Walkthrough.md#multi-controller-inputs) separately or simultaneously.
* Highly performant input handling with near frame-perfect inputs.
* Robust, pluggable virtual controller architecture - add your own custom virtual controller to support additional platforms and types of play.
* Run locally or through Twitch - TRBot is set up for easily integrating other services.
* Flexible console infrastructure - change inputs, add new inputs, or even add a new console with an entirely different set of inputs, on the fly.
* Modular - TRBot is separated into parts, allowing those parts to be used as a library in an application. The core application, `TRBot.Main`, functions this way.
* Commands - Modify, interact with, and obtain information from TRBot through commands entered as text. Commands can be simple, such as [`SayCommand`](./TRBot/TRBot.Commands/Commands/SayCommand.cs), or more complex, such as [`AddInputCommand`](./TRBot/TRBot.Commands/Commands/AddInputCommand.cs). You can even [add your own commands](./Wiki/Custom-Commands.md). 
* Twitch Plays quality-of-life enhancements - macros, game logs, user silencing (without timeout/ban), stop all ongoing inputs, and switch consoles on the fly.
* SQLite database with configurable data and settings, including access levels, commands, virtual controller count, and more. Any data changes are immediately reflected in TRBot.
* Sleep prevention - prevent games and consoles from going to sleep with a periodic input, controller port, and interval of your choosing.
* Reset prevention - forbid players from hitting button combos to reset the game.
* Moderation features - control access to commands, inputs, and other features independent of platform.
* Additional goodies and games - duel for credits, create memes, calculate expressions, and talk to a chatbot.
